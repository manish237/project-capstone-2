Manish, very nice project so far.
The project's functionality works as intended from my tests.
The ability to sort the search results gives the project a nice added functionality touch.
Most of my critique is around refining the look and feel of the app.

Landing Page

1. The landing page I think would look more modern full width, removing the outside padding on top, left, and right sides.
2. This would also help things not looking so tight on mobile.
3. The landing page with the 4 sections and photos for each could be condensed more. Right now there is a lot of white space.
4. The green bullet doesn't look great
5. and the bullet points could use further line-height so they aren't right on top of each other.
6. Every section doesn't need a "small description" sub header either.
7. I would provide a demo account as inline text on the returning users page so a hiring manager can quickly see the project.

The geo-location functionality is a nice touch. I also like that the app stills works without it. The header graphic on the landing page works better than the login page.

Home Page
8. The login page header is very busy and a bit distracting visually, the text doesn't pop on it.
9. The two rows of results don't need so much spacing in between them on desktop.
10. The login area on this page also breaks on tablet sized devices, the buttons and lost password text start breaking oddly.
11. When the results go one column on mobile I would add extra spacing above "Trending Restaurants..." header.

User Page
12. The sort area could use a little refinement. Less spacing below the sort select.
13. The radio buttons are also breaking to the next line oddly below 1000px.
14. To the right the "View Details" button could use a little more top spacing.

History Page
15. The search history page visually feels removed from the rest of the app, try to make it look more similar.
16. The text is also aligning to the left oddly on desktop for the search history results.
17. The navigation also disappears on this page.


Overall, nice project that with further visual refinement will really stand out. Keep up the great work and let me know however I can help. Cheers, Morgan
